/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the bakery canteen system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles, allowing users to read and modify their own data.
 * Orders are publicly readable, but only created with user-specific data.
 * The Inventory is publicly readable but only writable by the app backend (no user writes).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order history.
 * - /inventory/{inventoryId}: Stores inventory information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read their own profile data.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Anyone can read the orders and inventory.
 * - Only authenticated users can create orders.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Orders include the user's ID and Name which is used to quickly identify the creator of the order.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - The system uses separate collections for users, orders, and inventory, each with specific read/write access controls.
