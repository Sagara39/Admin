/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for users and orders,
 *              and allows public read access to inventory items while restricting
 *              writes to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the
 *   corresponding user.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information, accessible only to the user
 *   who placed the order. Each order document MUST contain a 'user_id' field
 *   matching the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /inventory/{inventoryId}: Stores inventory items, publicly readable,
 *   but writable only by authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Inventory is publicly readable to allow all users to view available items.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) require user authentication.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'orders' collection requires a 'user_id' field on each document to match
 *   the authenticated user's UID. This avoids the need for complex queries or
 *   additional reads to verify ownership.
