/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Bakery Canteen System
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user data,
 *                  allows public read access to inventory data, and restricts
 *                  order creation to authenticated users.
 *
 * @data_structure The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 *                  - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 *                  - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order history.
 *                  - /inventory/{inventoryId}: Stores inventory information.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users can only read and write their own user documents.
 *   - Inventory data is publicly readable but only writeable by authenticated users.
 *   - Order data can be created by authenticated users. Listing or getting orders is disabled.
 *   - Data validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping but critical ownership
 *     fields are validated to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - The rules use the `request.auth.uid` to verify user ownership, avoiding the need for
 *     additional `get()` calls to other documents.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 *   - Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, separate from the
 *     publicly readable inventory data in the top-level `/inventory` collection.
