/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Bakery Canteen System
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access to inventory and orders, with owner-only write access for orders, and allows any user to delete any item.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, secured with owner-only access.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information.
 * - /inventory/{inventoryId}: Stores inventory data, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Inventory is publicly readable to allow anyone to see available items.
 * - Orders are publicly readable
 * - Any user can delete any item.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   - The Order entity includes a `user_id` field, which is used to enforce owner-only writes.
